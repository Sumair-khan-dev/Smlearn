# smlearn 🧠📈

**smlearn** is a lightweight machine learning library built from scratch in **Python**, focused on understanding how core ML algorithms work under the hood.

This project is created for **learning, experimentation, and clarity**, not abstraction-heavy magic.

## ✨ Features (v0.0.1)

- Linear Regression (Normal Equation)
- Polynomial Regression (feature expansion)
- Minimal and readable implementation
- No external ML libraries used for learning logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/smlearn.git  
cd smlearn

### Important note about file placement
**Place `smlearn.py` in the same folder where you are running your Python script or IDE file.**  
This ensures Python can find the module without any import errors.  

Then, in your Python code:

```python
import smlearn
